There are two different versions of this software. 
One is written to be used in a Bash shell on a Unix/Linux machine, and the other for the windows shell.

The Bash compatible version is the preffered version as it uses Bash colour codes and the clear screen special character to make the game a lot easier to use. 

For either version go to the bin folder and run: 

    java MainProgram

This will run the application. Enter the number of reigons you want to play with, 2 being the hardest difficulty 4 being the lowest. 

Now you have to place the disease on the board. Ideally you want to place it as far away from the player as you can as this allows the player the highest chance of survival. 

If you can reach twenty steps and the player sruvives the baord gets reset and you place the disease again, this time though the player will act differently depending on what level you are on. 

Level 1: Player moves randomly
Level 2: Player runs away
level 3: Player either moves randomly or changes the neighbouring reigons
Level 4: Player runs away and then creates a cure for the disease

Have fun playing and good luck!
